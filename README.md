# What is this?

This repository is a space where I practice my design skills using Expo by recreating various app interfaces I find online. The focus is purely on design, including visual layouts and animations, to sharpen my UI/UX development capabilities.

# Why?

I am currently developing a gym lift progress tracker app and aim to improve my design skills to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Recreating app designs is a practical and effective way for me to learn and refine these skills.
